# Gradually Expanding Dense Neighbourhoods (GENA)

Gradually expanding neighborhoods with adjustment (GENA) is a new algorithm for the computational prediction of protein complexes by making the realistic assumption that proteins participate in multiple pro-tein complexes and cellular functions. GENA gradually expands neighborhoods in a graph starting from highly informative “seed”nodes. GENA considers proteins as multifunctional molecules allowing them to participate in more thanone protein complex. In addition, GENA accepts weighted PPI graphs by using a weighted evaluationfunction for each cluster.

This is the implementation of GENA in Matlab.
